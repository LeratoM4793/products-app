<p>Moët et Chandon was established by Épernay wine trader Claude Moët in 1743, and began shipping his wine from Champagne to Paris. The reign of King Louis XV coincided with increased demand for sparkling wine. Soon after its foundation, and after son Claude-Louis joined Moët et Cie, the winery's clientele included nobles and aristocrats. In 1833 the company was renamed Moet et Chandon after Pierre-Gabriel Chandon,joined the company as a partner of Jean-Remy Moet, Claude Moet's grandson. The Moët Impérial Brut NV is the House’s iconic champagne and one of the world's most-loved Champagne. Created in 1869, it embodies Moët & Chandon’s unique style, a style distinguished by its bright fruitiness, its seductive palate and its elegant maturity.

<h3>Tasting notes</h3>
The Moet & Chandon Imperial Brut NV is characterized by bright fruitiness and elegant maturity. The color is an elegant golden straw yellow with amber highlights. Radiant aromas reveal notes of apple, pear, yellow peach, honey, and floral nuances along with elegant blond notes of brioche and fresh nuts. The palate is seductive, richly flavorful and smooth combining generosity and subtlety, fullness and vigor, followed by a delicately fresh crispiness, to reveal the magical balance of Champagne.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Food Pairing</h3>
Moët Impérial can be served throughout the meal, from aperitif to dessert and pairs perfectly with sushi, scallops, oysters, white fish, and white meats such as roasted duck or chicken.</p>
