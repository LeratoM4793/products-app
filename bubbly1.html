<br/><br/>
		<h3>Brut NV</h3>
<br/><br/>
		<p>Strong, complex and unmistakable, the BNG MCC Brut takes a long heritage, steeped in the French technique and brings to life the labour of decades. 	In a collaboration between Wine Master Jeff Grier and one of South Africa’s most beloved personalities, Bonang Matheba, the pair have created a sensational brut that entices from the first sip.
<br/><br/>
Favouring the discerning palette, the brut is a dry MCC that delivers all the complexity and flavour one would expect from the gold standard and wine masters’ favourite. As the bubbles shimmer and dance atop the golden flute, the Brut invites you into a world of celebration. Reward your senses and indulge your desires with this elegant new offering.</p>
<br/><br/>
		<h3>Brut Rosé NV</h3>
<br/><br/>
		<p>The vibrant effervescent BNG MCC Rosé embodies the passion and charm of South Africa’s darling, Bonang Matheba. Bursting from the hills of Stellenbosch’s most famed wine producing farms, the bounty of the region is transformed by expert consultant and Cape Wine Master, Jeff Grier. Hand harvested to ensure minimal bruising, the Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier grape varieties are blended in age old French techniques that develop the flavours and naturally occurring bubbles to deliver a product of ultimate elegance and sophistication. In this rosé, the assemblage – art and science of combining the three grape varieties – is enlivened by the addition of red wine, creating a fruitful bouquet and a blush pink colour palette, exuding romance and sensuality.</p>
